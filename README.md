# Redfin-Housing-Price-Prediction

Last webscrape: 11/24/2023

Webscraped Berkeley CA housing info from redfin of sold houses using Beautiful Soup 

Used SciKit Learn to create a linear regression model using sold housing data to predict prices of houses currently on market

Model underestimated a lot of the houses, that could be due to high mortgage rates or inflation

Would add more variables such as walkability score in the future to have more location input as a variable
